(this is an example only. Edit this file as you see fit. It is recommended that you also include a copy of the original data used for this project in this folder - typically in `.csv` format)

We use the `video_games` dataset available at 
<https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2019/2019-07-30/video_games.csv>

This dataset includes information of roughly 9000 video games. 

The data fields included are: game, release_date, price, owners, developer, publisher, average_playtime, median_playtime, metascore (score of the game on the metacritic website)

Below we include some basic statistics for this datasets, including dimensions and range of years ...

(add basic summary if needed. Notice that the information above can be reused for one of the sections for the final project report)
